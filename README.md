# Text-to-Speech Converter(Serverless)

This project is a serverless application designed to convert text into speech using AWS Polly. The system is built with a React frontend, deployed to Amazon S3, and uses AWS API Gateway to handle HTTP requests. Terraform is used for infrastructure management, making it easy to deploy and manage resources in a repeatable, declarative way. <br>

## Key Components

React Frontend:
A user-friendly interface that allows users to input text, select voice options, and listen to the generated speech.
Hosted on S3 and served globally through CloudFront for optimized performance.

CloudFront:
A global Content Delivery Network (CDN) used to cache and deliver the static React app from S3 to users worldwide, ensuring low-latency and fast content delivery.

AWS API Gateway:
A serverless API to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate AWS services (e.g., Lambda for processing).

AWS Lambda:
A serverless compute service that processes text-to-speech requests, interacts with Polly to generate speech, and stores metadata in DynamoDB.
Also uploads the generated speech to S3 and returns the audio URL to the frontend.

AWS Polly:
Amazonâ€™s Text-to-Speech service, which converts text into lifelike speech.
Invoked by Lambda to generate speech from the userâ€™s input.

S3 (Simple Storage Service):
A scalable cloud storage service to host the static React app and store the generated speech audio files.
The React app is served via CloudFront.

DynamoDB:
A NoSQL database to store metadata for each text-to-speech request, such as user input, selected voice, timestamp, and audio file URLs.

Terraform:
Infrastructure as code tool used to define, provision, and manage AWS resources like API Gateway, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB.





## Architecture

## User Flow

User: The user submits text and voice choices via the React frontend.

CloudFront: Routes the request from the frontend to the API Gateway.

API Gateway: Receives the request and sends it to Lambda for processing.

Lambda: Processes the request, calls Polly for speech generation, and stores metadata in DynamoDB.

Polly: Converts the text into speech and returns the audio file.

S3: Lambda stores the generated audio file in S3.

CloudFront: Delivers the audio file to the user by serving it from S3.

User: The user receives and listens to the generated speech.


## Security Implementation

#### S3 Bucket Security

Private S3 Bucket: Store audio files in a private S3 bucket to ensure they are not publicly accessible by default.

Pre-signed URLs: Use pre-signed URLs to grant temporary access to the generated audio files. This ensures that only users with the URL can access the files, and the URL expires after a set period to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

IAM Policies for Lambda: Ensure the Lambda function only has permission to upload audio to the S3 bucket and not read other files or perform unnecessary actions.
Rate Limiting & Throttling

#### API Gateway Throttling: 
Set rate-limiting and throttling on API Gateway to prevent abuse or excessive requests. This helps mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or accidental overuse of resources.

#### Lambda Permissions

Minimal Lambda Permissions: Assign the Lambda function the minimum permissions needed to interact with AWS services. For example:

Invoke Polly: Permissions to call the Polly API (polly:SynthesizeSpeech).

Write to DynamoDB: Permissions to insert metadata into the DynamoDB table (dynamodb:PutItem).

Upload to S3: Permissions to upload audio to the S3 bucket (s3:PutObject).

IAM Roles for Lambda: Use a dedicated IAM role for Lambda with strict, specific policies to ensure the function has no more access than needed.

Lambda Concurrency Limits: Set concurrency limits for Lambda to ensure that excessive requests do not overwhelm the service and to avoid a potential service outage.

## Estimated Costs (for moderate usage)

Lambda:

1M requests, 500ms execution time (1GB memory)
â†’ Approx. $1.25/month

Polly:

1M characters processed using standard voices
â†’ Approx. $4.00/month

S3:

100GB storage + 1M PUT/GET requests
â†’ Approx. $15.50/month

API Gateway:

500,000 requests/month
â†’ Approx. $1.75/month

CloudFront:

100GB of data transfer + 500,000 requests
â†’ Approx. $13.50/month

DynamoDB:

10,000 writes/month, 1,000 reads
â†’ Approx. $2.50/month

#### Total Estimated Monthly Cost:

$38.50 for moderate usage.

## Testing the Application
To test the Text-to-Speech functionality, you can send a POST request to the API using curl. Here's how you can test it: <br>

curl -X POST "https://35smzwnuoc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/convert" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world, this is a test of the text-to-speech system", "voice": "Joanna"}'

## Challenges Faced 

During the development of the Text-to-Speech Converter system, several challenges were encountered, including CORS issues, cognito URL redirects, and rate limiting. Here's a breakdown of each challenge and how it was addressed: 

1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Issues 

    Challenge: 

    The frontend, hosted on Amazon S3 and served via CloudFront, made AJAX requests to the API Gateway. This led to CORS errors because the browser was blocking requests from different origins (frontend URL vs API Gateway URL). 

    Solution: 

    API Gateway CORS Configuration: The CORS policy was configured in API Gateway to allow requests from the specific domain where the frontend was hosted. 

    This was done by enabling CORS on API Gateway for all the required methods (GET, POST, etc.), and adding headers such as Access-Control-Allow-Origin to allow the frontend to communicate with the API. 

2. Cognito URL Redirect Issues 

    Challenge: 

    When integrating Amazon Cognito for user authentication, there were issues with URL redirects after login. After successful authentication, Cognito would redirect the user to a specified URL (e.g., the frontend app). Sometimes, the redirect did not work as expected, causing errors or sending users to the wrong URL. 

    Solution: 

    Callback URL Configuration: The callback URL was configured properly in Cognito to ensure that after successful login, users were redirected back to the correct page of the React app. 

    Cognito Hosted UI: Using Cognito's Hosted UI helped simplify the authentication process and allowed proper handling of redirects after login or sign-up. 

    URL Path Management: Managed URL paths within the frontend to correctly handle users coming back from the Cognito authentication page, ensuring they landed on the correct route (e.g., the home page or dashboard).
