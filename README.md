# Text-to-Speech Converter(Serverless)

This project is a serverless application designed to convert text into speech using AWS Polly. The system is built with a React frontend, deployed to Amazon S3, and uses AWS API Gateway to handle HTTP requests. Terraform is used for infrastructure management, making it easy to deploy and manage resources in a repeatable, declarative way.

## Key Components

React Frontend:
A user-friendly interface that allows users to input text, select voice options, and listen to the generated speech.
Hosted on S3 and served globally through CloudFront for optimized performance.

CloudFront:
A global Content Delivery Network (CDN) used to cache and deliver the static React app from S3 to users worldwide, ensuring low-latency and fast content delivery.

AWS API Gateway:
A serverless API to handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate AWS services (e.g., Lambda for processing).

AWS Lambda:
A serverless compute service that processes text-to-speech requests, interacts with Polly to generate speech, and stores metadata in DynamoDB.
Also uploads the generated speech to S3 and returns the audio URL to the frontend.

AWS Polly:
Amazonâ€™s Text-to-Speech service, which converts text into lifelike speech.
Invoked by Lambda to generate speech from the userâ€™s input.

S3 (Simple Storage Service):
A scalable cloud storage service to host the static React app and store the generated speech audio files.
The React app is served via CloudFront.

DynamoDB:
A NoSQL database to store metadata for each text-to-speech request, such as user input, selected voice, timestamp, and audio file URLs.

Terraform:
Infrastructure as code tool used to define, provision, and manage AWS resources like API Gateway, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, and DynamoDB.

## User Flow


## Security Implementation

#### S3 Bucket Security

Private S3 Bucket: Store audio files in a private S3 bucket to ensure they are not publicly accessible by default.

Pre-signed URLs: Use pre-signed URLs to grant temporary access to the generated audio files. This ensures that only users with the URL can access the files, and the URL expires after a set period to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

IAM Policies for Lambda: Ensure the Lambda function only has permission to upload audio to the S3 bucket and not read other files or perform unnecessary actions.
Rate Limiting & Throttling

#### API Gateway Throttling: 
Set rate-limiting and throttling on API Gateway to prevent abuse or excessive requests. This helps mitigate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or accidental overuse of resources.

#### Lambda Permissions

Minimal Lambda Permissions: Assign the Lambda function the minimum permissions needed to interact with AWS services. For example:

Invoke Polly: Permissions to call the Polly API (polly:SynthesizeSpeech).

Write to DynamoDB: Permissions to insert metadata into the DynamoDB table (dynamodb:PutItem).

Upload to S3: Permissions to upload audio to the S3 bucket (s3:PutObject).

IAM Roles for Lambda: Use a dedicated IAM role for Lambda with strict, specific policies to ensure the function has no more access than needed.

Lambda Concurrency Limits: Set concurrency limits for Lambda to ensure that excessive requests do not overwhelm the service and to avoid a potential service outage.

## Estimated Costs (for moderate usage)

Lambda:

1M requests, 500ms execution time (1GB memory)
â†’ Approx. $1.25/month

Polly:

1M characters processed using standard voices
â†’ Approx. $4.00/month

S3:

100GB storage + 1M PUT/GET requests
â†’ Approx. $15.50/month

API Gateway:

500,000 requests/month
â†’ Approx. $1.75/month

CloudFront:

100GB of data transfer + 500,000 requests
â†’ Approx. $13.50/month

DynamoDB:

10,000 writes/month, 1,000 reads
â†’ Approx. $2.50/month

#### Total Estimated Monthly Cost:

$38.50 for moderate usage.

## Testing the Application
To test the Text-to-Speech functionality, you can send a POST request to the API using curl. Here's how you can test it: <br>

curl -X POST "https://35smzwnuoc.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/convert" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello world, this is a test of the text-to-speech system", "voice": "Joanna"}'
